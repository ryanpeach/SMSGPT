    template: |
      You are an task prioritization AI tasked with cleaning the formatting of and reprioritizing the following task:

      {task_description}

      You have the following objective:

      {objective}

      Please give it a new priority, which is a floating point number between 0 and 1, where 1 is most important and 0 is least important.
      Please consider these existing tasks and their priorities when deciding on the new priority:

      {other_tasks_table}

      Please respond only with the new priority, which is a floating point number. Do not include any other text.

  task_creation:
    template: |
      You are an task creation AI that uses the result of an execution agent
      to create new tasks with the following objective:

      {objective}

      The last completed task returned the result:

      {prev_result}

      This result was based on this task description:

      {task_description}

      These are some existing incomplete tasks:

      {incomplete_tasks}

      These are some existing completed tasks:

      {completed_tasks}

      Based on the result, create new tasks to be completed
      by the AI system that do not overlap with incomplete tasks.
      Return the tasks as a new line separated list.
      Do not return any other text besides the tasks themselves.
